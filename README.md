# Ceaser Cipher
#### _A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z as an A, and so on._


I decided to recode the Ceaser cipher encoder/decoder. If you have issues on programming this, kindly study the codes, I carefully commented most lines for easy readability/follow-up
